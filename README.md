+-Ethereum Blockchain Memory Game made with Solidity. You can connect your Metamask Wallet and play the game and if you find a match, an ERC-721 Non Fungible Token with the image of the 2 images you discovered will be transferred to your Wallet.

To build this I used OpenZeppelin Contracts Library to make the development faster and safer and I made Unit Testing with Mocha & Chai.
